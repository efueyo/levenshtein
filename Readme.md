# Levenshtein

Calculates the (levenshtein distance)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance] between two strings.

If you want to use this functionality, this function is simple enough so it is
recommended to copy&paste its implementation (with the tests, if you want to)
rather than importing this repository as a module
